	 <h2>HLBM</h2>
	 <p>I followed the class Hospitality Luxury Brand Management. I really liked this class. We learned about the different famous luxury brands in the industry. We had the opportunity to listen to four speakers during this elective about perfumes brand, luxury hotel and watch brands. It was really interesting !</p>

	 <h2>Technology Trends</h2>
	 <p>My second elective was about VBA. It was challenging because we had to learn a whole new language in order to be able to do our final project. It gave me an overview of the intensive "Prototype your digital start-up if five days" although those two languages are very different.</p>
